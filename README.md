## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Functionality

This Memory Game has a lot of things to work on as a Developer. Here are few things you can look around in my web app:

You'd have sure played Memory Game (or Matching Game) in your childhood, and these are the same with an advanced functionality.

`Shuffling Cards`: Whenever you win the game and try again to play, the card shuffles and making the game difficult to play everytime to test your Memory :P

`Matching Check`: Matching is completely restricted to two cards at a time, and No other card is selected when two cards is being matched.

`Extra Features`: There is a timer, star rating and Moves count for your skill check on this game.

## Enjoy the slice of JavaScript with this Game :)

Thanks note: Thanks to me and @ezioda004.fend who helped me through building this app.
